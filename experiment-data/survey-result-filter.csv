Question 11 was about the band who said that their audience likes to stand and dance and some people like to sit in the back (or something along those lines). I think the correct answer would be the chef providing chopsticks or regular utensils to eat his food. I think the audience or the diners have a preference and the band and the chef like to honor that preference. And then on Question 14, I believe the correct answer was something like, ""It provides an example of how societies can misdiagnose food intolerance"". I thought the point of the paragraph was that it was NOT food intolerance, it was food poisoning. So we aren't misdiagnosing food intolerance, it's not food intolerance to begin with.
Sorry, I just couldn't help throwing in my two cents! :-)
